#### CW Backgrounder ([skip](#learning))

Modulating a continuously transmitting signal by switching it on and off in patterns that can encode information is just about the simplest way of communicating electronically. It is both the origion story of digital communication, with a rich and fascinating history, and a pragmatic method for modern use in peculiar circumstances.

Morse code is the pattern of 'dits' and 'dahs' that encode information. CW is a use of that code in which the transmitter produces a nearly pure tone at a particular radio frequency, and cleanly toggles that transmission on and off in the pattern we call Morse code. The code predated CW in the form of wired telegraphy and a cruder form of wireless called "spark gap", and of course, other codes of on-off keying have been invented that use different patterns or timings. The technical prowess of the CW mode comes from the modern CW transmitter designs and fundimentals of physics; whereas the heritage and, frankly, the practicality, comes from copying and sending in, for what was been since the beginning of electronic communication, the mother-toung of the airwaves.

For the radio amateur, using CW has several draws. Like the amateur sailor, it is a living demonstration of a connection to a shared heritage. Both as an expression of a hard-won skill, and as a tradition of using the same code as the early telographers who connected the Victorian world, Marconni and his peers who developed wireless technology, and the soldiers and sailors who exposed themselves to great risks over a century of peace and war to protect their people from harm in the ways only a person who can communicate vast distances could do. That is the heritage of our modern Internet and of international coopertion, and that is the heratige of the curios experimenter who wants to see what can be done with a little circuitry and knowledge of physics.

Beyond the romantic, the other draws are suprisingly pragmatic. A cw transmitter can be much simpler than one that has to modulate the signal in a more complicated manner -such as a voice signal. This simplicity makes home made transceivers more resobable a task, but it also means those radios can be far more power efficient. To compound that, transmitting all-or-nothing in a tiny slice of radiospectrum means an over the air power efficiency a great deal better than voice. The difference is so substantial, that a 5 watt "QRP" CW signal can be nearly as readable as a sideband voice signal being produced by a 100 watt transceiver. These two efficiencies make practical intercontinental contacts possible powered by flashlight batteries. This is a pragmatism that allows amateurs to comfortably hike to mountain summits and make these contacts. The narrow-band nature of CW also lends its self to rapid contacts between operators in crowded bands, wich makes it the go-to for radio contesters as well.

Today, digital modes can accomplish some of the super weak signal and rapid, crowded operations of CW, but at the cost of a greatly increased equipment complexity and relative power requirement. Both modes certainly have their place, but CW offers something special that seems to appeal to a great new people each year. What that is certainly varies from person to person, and likely includes far more than I have touched on above. However, for me it is all of those things that keep me coming back to wanting to be part of this tradition.

To be able to understand *every* part of the machine that talks through the sky, to be able to carry a station in a daypack pocket and make an international contact with it, or to be able to eek QSO's out of my regular station's 100 watts and compromise suburban antenna, and perhaps most of all, to connect across time with the fascinating people that worked the world from their keys and paddles when everyone else was limited to only those people in their sight.

#### [CW Learning](#learning)

My own journey to learning the code was long but rewarding. It could have been quicker had I followed the advice of the sages of the hobby with consistant, daily practice, but as with many, this is a hobby among many daily concerns. I dont find this dissapinting though, as I have approached code practice as a hobby in its self. I have spent countless hours learning about the different methods and tools and trying them out. It was a hobby that could involve 10 minutes of break at work to focus intently, or listen to some code while doing other things. Interestingly, I find that a short bust of focussed practice actually clears my mind like a form of meditation or relaxation. If someone chooses this haphazard path, they should know that it may be slow, but it still can be rewarding and ultimately successful.

As someone still very much learning, I will only provide 3 recommendations to others. As far as I know, these are entirely uncontroversial, and I doubt any respected CW teacher will dissagree with any:

  - Always practice at the minimal volume necissary for comfortable copy. Protect those ears. The amazing signal-to-noise capability of CW translates to simple audio practice, and even in a noisy environment, you may be suprised that very quiety tones are easy to copy.
  - Any resource that you find that presents you with visual cues (dots and dashes) isn't worth your time. You are learning an auditory language, and visual cruches will hurt your learning process almost immediately.
  - When you find something that seems to work for you, stick to it! It will get frustrating at times, and you might want to experiment with other ways of gaining exposure to the code, but don't give up on your primary learning tool too early.
  - Okay, I lied, one more; have fun! This is all for enjoyment.

One benefit to this path is having spent a lot of time researching and experimenting with learning tools. Below is a list of resources I can recommend for particular goals:

- [Learn Morse Code Online](http://lcwo.net): LCWO is the go-to for learning CW using the Koch meathod and Farnsworth timing. The Koch method involves starting with just two letters (at "full speed") and only adding new characters when you have learned to instantly recognise the ones you have. Farnsworth timing makes it easier to progress by increasing the time interval between letters. Slow code has no rhythum and it is too easy to count the dits and dahs -a recepy for stagnation, but increasing the time between characters allows you to keep the sound of the characters but not be overwhelmed by the speed you have to copy them.
- [CW-Academy](https://cwops.org/cw-academy/): The founders of a new breed of online in-person teaching. I have not done this, but I know a few people who have went through this process and have nothing but positive things to say. Even if you do not sign up, their website has all of the course materials so it is entirely possible to self-teach.
- Morse Machine. [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iu4apc.morsemachine&hl=en_CA), [Windows](http://www.g4ilo.com/morse-machine.html), [in-browser](https://lcwo.net/morsemachine), and many others.
  Not a specific product at all, but a software based teaching approach that plays the tone and waits for you to type it before proceeding. This works very well for rapidly learning to copy to keyboard. Most people find they make rapid progress through the letters, but have difficulty pushing their speed up above 12wpm overall, and often find that they can *only* copy letters to the keyboard -often without even having conscious knowledge of what they copied unless they look at the screen.
- Chuck Adams K7Q0 [Code Course](https://www.kkn.net/~k7qo/):
  Very few people seem interested in learning to copy code directly to pencil and paper, but if this is your goal, Chuck Adams' course is the way to do that.
- [Morse Code Ninja](https://morsecode.ninja/):
  This is a new one for me after hearing him interviewed on the [ditdit.fm](https://www.ditdit.fm/shows/episode-29-morse-code-ninja) podcast. I have been using his practice files heavily to work on copying callsigns and headcopy of other things. I think it is absolutely brilliant as a resource. I think this might be a great way to learn the letters and numbers as well. It seems like it would be a great way to learn head-copy from the start, rather than copying to keyboard.
