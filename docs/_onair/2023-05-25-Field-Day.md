Field Day is an annual 24-hour event where enthusiasts set up temporary stations in outdoor locations like parks, often using emergency power sources and working in teams. The goal is to promote collaboration and learning, as participants compete to contact as many other stations as possible. This fun, hands-on experience helps both new and seasoned hams develop their skills.

For this year (2023), I'm bringing the family to Michigan State Recreation Area to join friends for a group station. 
There are points awarded for a few "public outreach" type activities in addition to actually completing contacts (QSOs) during the event. 
One of those is having flyer available that describes the event, so I made one up:
