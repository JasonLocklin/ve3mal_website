## Design Goals
Us hams are used to going for those weak signals, and dealing with distortion and static for that really far-away station, and when I built an OTA antenna 
setup many years ago, that translates into a huge beam on a rotator and trying to get as many OTA stations as possible. If I could get Toronto and Buffalo 
stations, it ends up looking a lot like a basic cable package. I documented this in a long-lost blog post here: https://freeknowledge.wordpress.com/2012/10/02/digital-tv-antenna-in-kitchener-waterloo/
That was all taken down in a move, and in a world of extremely available streaming content, I havn't bothered to do it again since.


The downside: ATSC digital signals are extremely sharp, HD picture, but RF interference or weak signals can lead to terrible break-down. Visual glitches are
tolerable and show up as blocky parts of the screen, but audio glitches present as loud screeches and tones. I don't need all the content, but I would like
to have a 100% reliable signal for a few local channels. Channel 13 (VHF) for instance is extremely strong (you can pick it up with a paper clip in the antenna port), 
yet VHF digital TV is very prone to RFI interference. I decided I would like to be able to watch local news, or public television (TVO) over OTA. It would be nice
to be able to just switch it on and it work instantly (no menus), and ATSC is better picture than streaming live as well.
