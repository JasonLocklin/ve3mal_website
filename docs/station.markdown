# HF Station
I currently operate an IC-7300. At home, it is powered via a Jetstream JTPS32MAB switching 
power supply and feeds a 40m horizontal full wave loop in my attic. The feed system includes
a 4:1 Guanella balun and 1:1 choke balun at the feed point, and a second 1:1 at the shack end
along with a MFJ-945E mobile tuner that can be used when necessary. 

# QRP Portable Station
I use a CW-only Youkits HB1B while camping and pota. It's 5w out, and I use a variety of wire
antennas, combined with a "Mini SWR indicator" that I built from Pacific Antenna to tune them.

# FM
I usually have my Yaesu FT-3dr handheld radio with me. It us used for APRS, FM repeaters, and
with a MMDVM Pi-Star hotspot using YSF digital voice.
