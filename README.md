# ve3mal_website
Static html website for amateur radio stuff

Bare static web pages are in /src. They begin with a number and underscore. This determines the order they will be in the menu.

/bin contains two perl scripts and a bash script that runs them both. Running that will generate menues and place the html files 
in /doc for use in github pages as a static website.
