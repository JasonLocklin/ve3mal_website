<p>Some notes/tips on programming a Baofeng or simmilar radio with CHIRP:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li><p>Use a csv file as your personal “master” source, then import to image file each time. This allows the use of the “comments” column CHIRP that can be used for grouping memories. It also doesn’t restrict you to the maxiumum number of memories the radio supports. You can then selectively import groups of memories to stay within the radio’s limits. Repeaterbook pulls in the city location under the “Comments” column, but I edit that to a larger regional area so that it is effectively a pseudo-group for whenever I am in that area.</p></li>
<li><p>Use those pseudo-groups in the comments column to selectively enable scanning (i.e., disable skip) on a few local memories. Baofengs scan very slowly, so it’s necissary to restrict your scanning to ~10 memories. Temporarily sort-by comments column by clicking the column header. Shift-click to select multiple rows, right-click and properties to change this setting for many memories at once. This can be done before traveling, for instance, to quickly enable scanning of a new regional area.</p></li>
<li><p>I keep the repeater callsigns in the alphanumeric names field. When travelling, use repeaterbook or simmilar mobile app to identify local repeater, and quickly flip through the memories to find it. To speed this, I sort the repeater portion of the memory bank by callsign. This cannot be done in CHIRP. I open the csv file in excel, select all the repeater rows and sort by the name field. Be sure to exclude the first column from the sort, CHIRP uses that for the memory number, not the actual order of the sheet. Note that you can re-sort by the comment column to re-group these memories by location whenever necissary. I keep all the other memories sorted by the comment column so they are grouped nicely.</p></li>
<li><p>I keep a few extra simplex frequencies, with the frequency as the name field, to make it easy to QSY to a non-calling simplex frequency. Otherwise, I need to power off the radio, and power it on again holding the memory button to switch to VFO mode. Transmit tone is enabled (100.0hz). I’ve heard some people use TSQL for simplex so, just in case, it’s enabled (it can’t hurt). Keeping a simplex memory channel with TSQL enabled may also be useful for indoor/local work (like a hamfest), to avoid RFI potentially opening the squelch (an issue that especially plagues Baofengs, with their poor selectivity). Remember: Tone mode = “Tone” just transmits a tone, but doesn’t effect your rx. “TSQL” will prevent your own squelch from opening unless the received signal includes a tone.</p></li>
<li><p>APRS voice alert for simplex QSOs: A regular aprs memory is useful with a cable to an android device and aprsdroid, but also keep a seperate APRS-VA memory set to both transmit and tone-squelch of 100.0 hz (Tone-Mode = “TSQL”, Tone=100.0 in CHIRP, frequency is same as APRS). <strong>Do not use the cable for this one, this is for finding simplex voice QSOs!</strong>. You will only hear packets from nearby mobile stations within simplex range who are also using voice alert (i.e., very infrequently). If you hear one, you can respond with “$THEIRCALL, $MYCALL using voice alert. Please QSY to $SIMPLEXFREQUENCY for a QSO” or something like that. Keep it short to avoid interfering with APRS, but you may need to repeat yourself if your transmission was doubled by someone’s APRS burst. Note that if there is a station using voice alert within simplex range, you will only hear a single short burst from them every minute or so, which will be easy to miss when scanning. Either leave the radio parked on this memory, or use the dual-watch feature of the radio if available. It may be obvious, but for this to work, you are relying on others with more advanced APRS-capable radios that can beacon and decode APRS internally, while simultaniously using TSQL to keep their speaker quiet most of the time. On a simpler radio, we have to chose one or the other. For more info, see http://www.aprs.org/VoiceAlert3.html</p></li>
